<b><i>~Mike</i></b> has spent the last 2 decades in the enterprise integration space. Beginning with his love for J2EE, emerged a love for Service Oriented Architecture and as the years carried on his romance with MicroServices and cloud native distributed integration platforms began to really flourish.</p>

<p align="left">Mike, spent his college years at the <b><i>University of Texas</i></b> and currently works for <b>Red Hat as an <i>Architect</i> in an Emerging Techonology Practice (Enterprise Integration) of Red Hat Consulting</b>. His views may or may not be shared by his employer (or anyone else for that matter). When not swashbuckling with containers, or integrating event streams, Mike may be found kicking a soccer ball around the <b>Austin, Texas area</b>.</p>
